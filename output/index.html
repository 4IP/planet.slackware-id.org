<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Cinnamon developer has tagged 6.6.x releases on their github projects, meaning that the official release of Cinnamon 6.6 is <strike>imminent</strike> now official. I have <strike>prepared a special branch (6.6)</strike> pushed on both <a href="https://github.com/CinnamonSlackBuilds/csb/">github</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/CinnamonSlackBuilds/csb/">gitlab</a> for those who wanted to test the script <strike>(Note: i haven't tried to build this yet)</strike>. This branch is targeting for Slackware-Current users, so it may not work for users running Slackware 15.0 (again, i have not tested this under 15.0 since master branch is tracking -current only).</p><p>Update: Binaries are now pushed to <a href="https://slackware.uk/csb/current/x86_64/">slackware.uk</a> (thanks to Tadgy for providing this space) </p><p>As usual, Cinnamon is improving on every release, but it wasn't like a revolutionary changes, more like small improvements on every aspect. Some highlight on this release based on the ChangeLog:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Modernized on-screen keyboard handling with the goal of removing caribou which has been archived upstream (cinnamon 6.8 in 2026 is the planned milestone target for caribou removal)</li><li>Improve Wayland support</li><li>Revamp the main menu display</li><li>Switch to XApp symbolic icons </li><li>Wayland-compatible keyboard/IM handling</li><li>Pause file operations in Nemo</li></ul><p>Here's an early look of the future Cinnamon 6.6 (taken from <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=4968">LinuxMint Blog)</a>:</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/upload/2025/12/shadow_menu4-744x613.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="613" src="https://blog.linuxmint.com/upload/2025/12/shadow_menu4-744x613.png" width="744" /></a></div><p></p><p>The final display may look differently in Slackware due to minimum customization on CSB project side, but you still have the basic idea. </p><p> Here's what XSI icons look like</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/upload/2025/11/xsi.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="362" src="https://blog.linuxmint.com/upload/2025/11/xsi.png" width="569" /></a></div> Unfortunately, cjs hasn't receive much love and it's still based on older mozjs128, so i need to re-introduce mozjs128 back to this repository in order for Cinnamon to work in Slackware-Current. I wished they move forward to support MozJS140.<p style="text-align: left;">Here's the default look on Slackware-Current:<img alt="" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjWx7d2vUMkwlhQR8JCaFBTl4kl5uCmOVCp_Wi3uBuQl6VT4euk8y4ZCnLbViRZxodi6s0UAY6Y6FIBEB-eyLvnT65SS5lyXxXwG8ajOomEtym8wNnQBQI3F3OuvzpsEKlmzL0jGPGWgTqtSfh_QX3d_MK2wG5eyskH2N85fJLHbe1NCzVeiV8EtvhlfUY" /></p></div>

<p>If you are MATE users and having issues with MATE uses reverse scrolling (when you scroll down using the middle mouse wheel, it went up instead of down) and want to use the natural scrolling, here's a simple tip to solve the issue:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Open /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-libinput.conf</li><li>Add the following codes:<br /><blockquote><b>Section "InputClass"<br />    Identifier "My Mouse"<br />    MatchIsPointer "on"<br />    Option "NaturalScrolling" "on"<br />EndSection </b></blockquote></li><li>Save and reboot</li></ul><p>In the past, i remember there's an option in the control center &gt; hardware &gt; mouse to reverse this option, but in MATE 1.28, i think it's been removed. </p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p style="text-align: left;">During Cinnamon 6.4 development process, i opened a <a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/cjs/issues/124">ticket for cjs</a> in order to support mozjs128 since Slackware-Current has switched from mozjs115 to mozjs128 and cjs wasn't able to built against it. Since there were no sign of changes at that time, i had to include mozjs115 in CSB project alongside with the existing mozjs128 in Slackware core packages. This was quite painful since it took a long time to compile this project and it was aging so more patches needed in order to build properly.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Today i got a notice from Clem that a new commit has been pushed to rebase cjs to support mozjs128 and i  cherry-picked that commits (<a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/cjs/commit/f43d5b579a6d84f4947ee61fde6f00b7ee6c1155">1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/cjs/commit/daa405768117f016b0db2768eef57856815b6b5f">2</a>) into cjs today and i can say it worked nicely with what we have in Slackware, so i decided to push them forward. I rebuilt cinnamon and removed mozjs115 packages from CSB repository and pushed the binaries into slackware.uk repository as well.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Let me know if you found some regression due to this changes.</p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Yesterday i took some time to push the updates for my CSB project to the latest major release of Cinnamon 6.4 on top of latest Slackware Current. This is basically an incremental update so the upgrade process is quite smooth. Nothing major was introduced in this release, so i don't expect major issues with Cinnamon 6.4.</p><p>The only problem i had was the removal of mozjs115 from Slackware since they moved to newer mozjs128 and cjs still require that version (i opened an <a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/cjs/issues/124">issue</a> but no response yet from the developer). I guess they will update the mozjs in the next major release.</p><p>All the scripts has been uploaded to Github and Gitlab and binary packages for Slackware-Current has been uploaded to slackware.uk repository, thanks to Tadgy. The hosting facility had some networking issue when i wanted to upload yesterday, so i waited until today to post it, but it's back up now.</p><p>Here's the new look of Cinnamon 6.4 in the default configuration. Looks like they changed the default color to darker tone since 6.2.</p><p>Let me know if you encounter issues with Cinnamon project and Happy Thanksgiving<br /></p><p></p><p><img class="sc-98816d77-2 cPTpYb" src="https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/116887388/994a6ba321314b1d8d3546dfb027b903/eyJ3Ijo2MjB9/1.png?token-time=1734134400&amp;token-hash=Jo5xMbbdoD4e01OCyRb023IK1exzIOjebdJQnwKpWQQ%3D" /></p></div>

<h4><a href="https://slackblogs.blogspot.com/2024/09/dual-boot-issue-after-windows-11-23h2.html">Dual Boot Issue After Windows 11 23H2 Updates</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have just updated your Windows 11 machine recently and suddenly you found out that it broke your dual-boot setup, then most likely you were hit by another big regression by Microsoft. The error message that you might see when you boot your Linux will be something like this:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center;"><span style="color: red;"><b>”Verifying shim SBAT data failed: Security Policy Violation. Something 
has gone seriously wrong: SBAT self-check failed: Security Policy 
Violation.”</b></span></p><div style="text-align: left;">This issues was caused by a failed mechanism to detect some custom dual-boot environment and it applied a SBAT value which should not be implemented in normal dual-boot environment.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">If you are planning to install or happened to install the updates but you haven't rebooted your machine, you are considered lucky as you can prevent this update to be applied during your reboot. In order to do that, open Power Shell (using administrator access) and run:</div><div style="text-align: center;"><b style="color: #2b00fe;">reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecureBoot\SBAT /v OptOut /d 1 /t REG_DWORD</b></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">This will prevent the SBAT update to be applied as part of the August 2024 Windows update and future Windows updates.</div><div style="text-align: left;"> </div><div style="text-align: left;">If you already rebooted and faced with above situation, i would suggest you to read this <a href="https://www.elevenforum.com/t/aug-13th-windows-update-broke-dual-boot-windows-10-11-and-linux-pcs.27827/">article</a>. You might need to install 3rd party packages provided by AlienBOB in his repository to get <a href="https://slackware.uk/people/alien/slackbuilds/mokutil/">mokutils</a>. In the article, it is suggested to disable secure boot, but i think Slackware will not be able to be installed when secure boot is enabled and active, so i disabled Secure Boot before i install Slackware-Current. I guess that article will be useful for those who have Secure Boot enabled and the Linux distribution that they used supports Secure Boot.<br /></div></div>

<h4><a href="https://slackblogs.blogspot.com/2024/09/my-new-ryzen-based-laptop.html">My New Ryzen-based Laptop</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<div class="separator"><p style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">My current laptop has been around for more than 7 years since i bought it on March 2017 and it was based on <a href="https://slackblogs.blogspot.com/2017/03/slackware-with-kaby-lake-hardware.html">Kabylake</a> CPU architecture. I had some fun tweaking it in order to work with Slackware since it was considered new hardware at that time with dual GPU (Optimus), my first dual-boot experience with Secure Boot option in the motherboard and also using grub instead of LILO which i have been used to for more than 15 years. It's still working well and i'm still using it for my daily activities, but since i switched to Ryzen-based CPU for my desktop at home and more recently my workstation at the office and both performed really well with more affordable price as well, i'm tempted to switch to Ryzen-based laptop for my future laptop.</p></div><div class="separator"><p style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">Well, this year i had a plan to upgrade my laptop to a new laptop and i have been eyeing on some products in the market and after one week of researching all the pros and cons, i decided to take on <a href="https://www.asus.com/laptops/for-gaming/tuf-gaming/asus-tuf-gaming-a15-2024/">ASUS TUF Gaming A15 (2024)</a>. It's a beautiful product with all my requirements are on board:</p></div><p><br /></p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Must have expansion slots for memory and storage because i want to put maximum 32GB of DDR5 5600 MHz RAM and also i wanted different storage disk for Windows and my Slackware. Luckily this product came with 1TB of NVMe-based SSD, so i just need to add another NVMe for my Slackware setup.</li><li>Generous of I/O ports. This product came with 1x 3.5mm Combo Audio Jack, 1x HDMI 2.1 FRL<br />2x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, 1x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C support DisplayPort™ / power delivery / G-SYNC, 1x RJ45 LAN port, and 1x Type-C USB 4 support DisplayPort™.</li><li>Must have RJ-45 jack. This is important for me as i still prefer wired connectivity over wireless for stability. Some products have removed this for the sake of weight and compact size</li><li>I wanted recent processors with AI capabilities, so i'm aiming for Ryzen 9 8945H with 4GHz (24MB Cache, up to 5.2 GHz, 8 cores, 16 Threads);  AMD XDNA™ NPU up to 16TOPS</li><li>NVidia GPU. I'm not a gamer but having dedicated GPU is definitely better, so i picked NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 4060 Laptop GPU (233 AI TOPs), 1940MHz* at 140W 
(1890MHz Boost Clock+50MHz OC, 115W+25W Dynamic Boost), 8GB GDDR6. The AMD Radeon Graphics is also included as part of the Ryzen CPU.<br /></li><li>Good battery life. It came with 90WHrs, 4S1P, 4-cell Li-ion, which is very good compared to other products that i reviewed.</li><li>Silent under heavy load. ASUS is doing a great job on handling the air flows of this product</li><li>Must be durable for my line of work, and luckily it came with military grade certification <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIL-STD-810">MIL-STD-810H</a></li></ul><p>  <img alt="View of the lid of the TUF Gaming A15, with emphasis on the embossed logo." class=" lazyloaded" height="278" src="https://dlcdnwebimgs.asus.com/files/media/fd011465-8c85-4f94-88db-97b31f593615/v1/images/desktop/design/design_pd_mecha.png" width="400" /></p><p>This product came with Windows 11 Home installed, so when i got this product, i decided to setup it as soon as possible because in the past, i would need a whole day to setup for each platform (Windows and Linux), but surprisingly, i managed to do it in just few hours.</p><p>Once Windows is done, i took my time to prepare the latest Slackware-Current ISO from my local mirror setup at home because i'm using NVMe-based SSD along with newer Ryzen-based processors, so 15.0 might not be a good choice and since i'm already using -current on all my machines at home and workstation, i'm sure that it's a good choice and reduce my problems with newer hardware.</p><p>Well, turned out it paid well. The installation went smooth and it was finished in just few minutes and before rebooting, i managed to setup up GRUB instead of ELILO, but after rebooting, it went directly to boot Windows, so i noticed a problem there. It turned out that the GRUB installation was not handled correctly, so i booted again using Flash Drive and i choose boot existing OS and i chose Slackware Linux and from then i followed the same path as before</p><p>- Create a new initrd (i know it's no longer used since the generic kernel in -current had all the modules ready, but it's just old habbit and it should be safer, so i ran <b>geninitrd</b> to include all the required modules into initrd file)</p><p>- Install GRUB into proper location. The reason it failed during installation was probably because i didn't mount the proper EFI partition from my Windows system so the image wasn't installed properly and didn't overwrite Windows' boot manager. I used this command: <b>grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi/EFI -v</b></p><p>- Update GRUB installation using <b>update-grub</b> script. </p><p></p><p style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" height="388" width="400" /></p>Afterwards, i rebooted and voila, GRUB menu appeared and i went directly to boot my Slackware-Current and man, it was very fast. The boot process only takes like 4s to get the login prompt thanks to the NVMe-based SSD. I started my X session on Plasma 5 and everything is well detected including WiFI, something that often bugged people for days in the past. I don't really configure much on this new laptop as everything is just working out of the box. This is the screenshot from the Plasma 5 system setting.<p></p><p>With basic configuration done, i followed by installing <a href="https://sbopkg.org/">sbopkg</a> to install other packages that i need for daily work and i finished it under an hour or two.</p><p>One thing that i still haven't managed to setup is <a href="https://openrgb.org/">openrgb</a> since my product is not yet listed on their website. It wasn't able to detect my chipset properly so it crashed when i tried to setup the keyboard backlighting, but i don't need that feature anyway. I was just curious about it and i also disabled the backlighting on my Windows setup as well to gain more battery life.</p><p>In general, this product works well for me and i'm super happy that Slackware also works fine with this without too much hassle and efforts. I also didn't encounter <a href="https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/shutdown-oddness-asus-tuf-a16-slackware64-current-post-15-0-a-4175740169/">shutdown issue reported in LQ</a>. If you are looking for a new laptop that works well with Slackware Linux or perhaps with any other Linux distribution (i never tested this yet but i'm sure you should have no issues if you are using recent kernel version), you might want to consider this product on your next wishlist.<br /></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Six months have gone by since i pushed <a href="https://slackblogs.blogspot.com/2023/12/cinnamon-60-packages-for-slackware.html">Cinnamon 6.0 packages for Slackware-Current</a> last year and here we are with a new Cinnamon 6.2 packages for Slackware-Current. As with previous releases, upstream never posted anything except for detailed commit logs in their github repository, so based on several sources who gathered information about this release, here are the main visible changes for this major release:</p><ul><li>Cinnamon sessions now have greeter badges</li><li>Search bar shows by default when adding to <em>Startup Applications</em></li><li>New screen lock delay options: 5 &amp; 10 seconds</li><li>Workspace Switcher supports removing workspace with middle click</li><li>Cinnamon Spices now support configurable keybindings </li><li>Keybindings now searchable (in keyboard shortcuts editor)</li><li>User applet supports showing user profile pic on panel</li><li><em>Mint Menu</em> gains a ‘Science’ category</li><li>Cornerbar applet makes click actions configurable</li><li>OSK picks up a toggle to disable the OSK</li><li>Active VPN connections append padlock to network icons</li></ul><p>Upstream also added a new project called <a href="https://github.com/xapp-project/gnome-online-accounts-gtk">GNOME Online Accounts GTK</a>, but i haven't added this into CSB project for now as i'm still evaluating if this is a necessary package to include or not. It's just a GTK front end so if people do not really need this integration, i will skip it until they set it as mandatory.</p><p></p><p>As usual, the SlackBuild scripts has been pushed to our <a href="https://github.com/CinnamonSlackBuilds/csb/">github</a>/<a href="https://gitlab.com/CinnamonSlackBuilds/csb">gitlab</a> repository and binary packages has been uploaded to Slackware.UK (Thanks to Tadgy for providing this). Hopefully it will be included in <a href="https://download.liveslak.org/">AlienBOB's liveslack images</a> next release. Last update was in January when Cinnamon 6.0 get included.<br /></p><p></p></div>

This branch should be used if you are using stable release (15.0) instead of current.</p><p></p><p>For current users, you need to use master branch as there has been some minor changes for now, mainly removal of 2 packages which are now included in Slackware main tree: libsoup3 and lxml. I will keep track of current changes in master branch only. There are no binary packages for current at this point due to this reason. When upstream pushes changes that only works on current, i will start building binary packages spesific for current users.<br /></p><p>There hasn't been any major changes in this release, mainly just minor bug fixes, so don't expect big surprises. It's a small and continuous changes, which is good for stable releases of Slackware. I'm expecting that the next release should be targetted for next Slackware version (15.1).</p><p>Just for your information, Johannes Schoepfer also uploaded some of MATE components to SBo, so if you would like to build them from SBo repository, that should give the same results.<br /></p></div>

<h4><a href="https://slackblogs.blogspot.com/2023/12/cinnamon-60-packages-for-slackware.html">Cinnamon 6.0 Packages for Slackware-Current</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Cinnamon 6.0 tarballs has been released for some time and i didn't push the updates directly because normally it would take some time for upstream to stabilize the project with some minor releases before it's labeled as stable and the new version is announced. Well, it's not really the case for Cinnamon 6.0 where it has been stayed in 6.0.0 in most components for some time, so i decided to fire up my VM and started building it.</p><p>Surprisingly, it doesn't take that long to finish building all Cinnamon components this time. Slackware-Current has all the basic requirements except for some new packages that was introduced in this cycle: python3-webencodings, tinycss2 (replacing tinycss), and mint-l-icons as the new default icons theme. I have removed libcroco since upstream is archiving the project and everything is ok without libcroco. I also made some changes to the default schema for new user, which is defaulting the icon theme to Mint-L. One issue with the default icon theme is that it's lacking some default icons in the menu launcher, some of them are important icons, like cinnamon-control-center. With the new icon theme, it works nicely and it has more vibrant colors.<br /></p><p>While the biggest thing about Cinnamon 6.0 is about Wayland support, which claimed to be working well in most cases, i haven't tried much during my test. Upstream is targeting for 2026 for complete Wayland transition from Xorg.<br /></p><p>Binary packages are uploaded to <a href="https://slackware.uk/csb/current/x86_64/">Slackware.UK</a> repository (credit goes to Tadgy) and SlackBuild scripts has been uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/CinnamonSlackBuilds/csb/">github</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/CinnamonSlackBuilds/csb">gitlab</a>.</p><p>Let me know if there's some issues with the build scripts. Until then, enjoy Cinnamon 6.0<br /></p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>If you are concerned about security vulnerabilities affecting your CPU like Spectre, ZenBleed, etc, you might want to add microcode provided by your CPU vendors, like Intel or AMD and also make sure to get the latest kernel that provided the support to mitigate the vulnerabilities.</p><p>Installing microcode alone is not enough as we still need to load it early during boot so it needs to be added into your loader, whether you use LILO, ELILO, or GRUB2. Since i'm using GRUB2, this is how you add them. I'm using Intel CPU so i need to install <a href="https://slackbuilds.org/repository/15.0/system/intel-microcode/">intel-microcode</a> package from SlackBuilds first.<br /></p><p>To generate the microcode cpio archive, use this following command:</p><p><span style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="background-color: white; color: black;"><b>iucode_tool -S --write-earlyfw=/boot/early_ucode.cpio /lib/firmware/intel-ucode/*</b></span></span></p><p>This command will try to seach for the correct signature based on your CPU. In my system, this will results in:</p><p><span style="font-family: monospace;"><b><span style="background-color: white; color: black;">iucode_tool: system has processor(s) with signature 0x000806e9
</span><br />iucode_tool: Writing selected microcodes to: /boot/early_ucode.cpio</b></span></p><div style="text-align: left;">GRUB will detect the cpio archive automatically if it has the name of the following values:  intel-uc.img, intel-ucode.img, amd-uc.img, amd-ucode.img, early_ucode.cpio, or microcode.cpio<span style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 95%;">. </span>If you use different name, like ucode.cpio, you need to open /etc/default/grub and add the following line:</div><p><span style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="background-color: white; color: black;"><b>GRUB_EARLY_INITRD_LINUX_CUSTOM="ucode.cpio"</b></span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: monospace;"></span>Regenerate grub.cfg by running <b>grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</b></p><p>You will notice that the newly cpio archive is included as well:</p><p><b><span style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="background-color: white; color: black;">Found initrd image: /boot/early_ucode.cpio /boot/initrd.gz</span></span></b></p><div style="text-align: left;">Lastly, check your system with <a href="https://github.com/speed47/spectre-meltdown-checker">https://github.com/speed47/spectre-meltdown-checker<span style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="background-color: white; color: black;"> </span><br /></span></a></div></div>

<p>It's been a while since i posted on this blog and last post was about Cinnamon 5.6.0 and now, it's time to jump to Cinnamon 5.8.0 packages for Slackware-Current.

It's not a mandatory requirements, but cinnamon-settings does have this support when the package is available.

<p>Three months since i posted Cinnamon 5.4 and here we are with Cinnamon 5.6 release for Slackware-Current. As usual, there is no release notes yet as this post is written, but based on the commit message per components, it seems that this release doesn't have major features compared to previous releases. Most of the changes are refinement to what 5.4 had offered and they want to polish the desktop even further.</p><p>I have pushed the changes for building Cinnamon 5.6 to master branch in github/gitlab repository and pushed the binaries into <a href="https://slackware.uk/csb/">Slackware.UK repository</a> (Thanks to Tadgy). As usual, i tested them using Slackware-Current as base, so i can't guarantee that it will work on Slackware 15.0. There will be more updates to the Cinnamon projects over few weeks before they are finalized.</p><p>Please give it a test and feedback on the build script.<br /></p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>I have been playing with Cinnamon 5.4 packages for some time and i think it's now ready since it has reached 5.4.10 and LinuxMint 21 has been released, meaning they have been finalized. One of the reason why i didn't publish it sooner is because i was experiencing crashes on my VBox tests, rapid changes in -Current, and lack of spare time to deal with this project due to my workload at the office.</p><p>There are 2 new packages introduced in this new major version: gsound and xdotools. I was trying to remove caribou, cogl, clutter, and clutter-gtk from this version, but it seems that some components still looking for them, so i added them back even though <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/clutter/2022/02/16/retiring-clutter/">upstream have declared the project no longer maintained</a>.</p><p>The new Cinnamon 5.4 comes with a new icon sets and also faster loading time to the desktop (if you are using runlevel 3). Remember that you need proper 3D acceleration in order to use Cinnamon. I tested it under VirtualBox and it worked smoothly. One small issue i found is missing the control center icon on the favorite.</p><p>Binaries have been pushed to the <a href="https://http://slackware.uk/csb/current/x86_64/">usual repository</a>, thanks to Tadgy for providing this repository and the sources have been merged into <a href="https://github.com/cinnamonslackbuilds/csb">master branch</a>. Enjoy Cinnamon 5.4 packages on top of Slackware Current.<br /></p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Some people have been asking about how to send patches to SBo when submission is still closed (usually during development cycle for next SBo repository or for a while after new repo is released). There are a few ways to do it:</p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Use a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">pull request on GitHub</a> or <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/">merge request on GitLab</a></li><li>Send a patch using git format-patch to the mailing list</li></ol><p>The first option has its own documentation, so please go look on the specific platform that you prefer. For  the second option, here's how to do it.</p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Make sure you clone the latest changes from master branch or if you haven't done it, use this command:  <b><br />git clone git://git.slackbuilds.org/slackbuilds.git &amp;&amp; cd slackbuilds<br /></b></li><li>Make a new branch (eg. yourname)<br /><b>git checkout -B willysr</b><br /></li><li>Make changes to your scripts and commit using this command:<br /><b>git commit -asm "category/script: Updated for version X.Y.Z"<br /></b>NOTE: 1 commit for each script!<br /></li><li>Make a patch using git format-patch and save it to home directory (assuming it's willysr)<br /><b>git format-patch master.. &gt; /home/willysr<br /></b>NOTE: double dot means from master to latest changes in your branch<br /><b></b>it will give you output like this: 0001-libraries-antlr4-Update-DEP.patch<br /></li><li>Send those patches to the SBo mailing list or maintainer to be tested and merged  </li></ol></div>

<p>After more than 6 years of development and so many big changes happened during the development cycle, Patrick Volkerding finally released Slackware 15.0 into another stable release.

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p> I noticed that Cinnamon 5 is now available from their github project page, so last night i started to work on it and it seems that it's a trivial update to the build scripts. There's no hackish or extra effort to update the build script to build the latest Cinnamon 5.x on top of Slackware-Current. Since it was late at night, i finished bumping and i left to sleep while the build machine test the script while i was asleep.</p><p>This morning, i can confirm that the build is working fine, thus i uploaded all the binaries to the <a href="https://slackware.uk/csb/current/x86_64/">usual place</a> (thanks again Tadgy for providing this access). All the changes to the build script has been pushed to github as well if anyone is interested to build from scratch.</p><p>I don't have any detail about changes implemented in Cinnamon 5, but some of the new features can be seen in the <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=4054">LinuxMint newsletter back in April</a>. The official announcement usually follows after it has been considered stable enough.<br /></p></div>

<h4><a href="https://slackblogs.blogspot.com/2021/05/running-steam-and-windows-games-on.html">Running Steam and Windows Games on Slackware Linux without Multilib</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Few years ago, i was quite lucky to get 3 free games from Ubisoft 
Holiday Bundle, Assasin Creed IV: Black Flag, World in Conflict: 
Complete Edition, and Watch Dogs. I played Assasin Creed IV for a while 
under Windows in my spare time, but later on, i rarely login to my 
Windows machine (it's only available on my laptop, not in my other 
machines), so it's kinda abandoned.<br /></p><p></p><p></p><p style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" height="400" width="317" /></p>The arrival of Steam under Linux does give some  inspiration, but it also comes with it's own problems. In order to install/use Steam you need to have 32 bit libraries installed. This can be achieved in Slackware by using multilib provided by <a href="https://alien.slackbook.org/blog/">Eric Hameleers</a>, but you must be really careful when using Slackware-Current since changes in -current can break your multilib. It's not officially supported by Slackware, so you must rely on community to help your issues if you encountered them. Many people have been using this approach and it worked just fine for them. I didn't install multilib on my machines because i'm not really a hard core gamers. I just play games on my spare time and it's not my highest priority.<p></p><p>Few days ago i saw this thread on <a href="https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/unprivileged-container-to-run-wine-steam-on-slackware64-with-no-multilib-4175692728/">LQ about running unprivileged containers</a>  and i think it's an interesting topic to try on weekend, so i directly downloaded <a href="https://github.com/Kron4ek/Conty">Conty</a> on my desktop at home (running pure Slackware64-Current) and try to use it and it worked. I'm able to install <a href="https://ubisoftconnect.com/">Ubisoft Connect</a>, the ecosystem of players services for Ubisoft games across all platforms which later can be used to download/install/play all Ubisoft-based games. It's like Steam but coming from Ubisoft. I copied the files from my Windows machine in order to avoid downloading a massive 41 GB source and now i can play my games again.</p><p>Conty is a non-root container compressed into squashfs and packed
into a single executable based on <a href="https://archlinux.org/">ArchLinux</a>. You can use this container to run any applications, including games that requires Vulkan or OpenGL. In the project's repository on github, you can also see many other information regarding this project.</p><p>So, here's what i did in order to play games on my Slackware-Linux without using multilib:</p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Download the conty releases (i choose to the conty.sh at the beginning, but later on i switch to conty_lite.sh for lighter version). From the release page: <i>"The lite version (conty_lite.sh) includes everything from the regular 
version (conty.sh), except for: gcc, mingw-w64-gcc, firefox, meson, 
cmake and jre8-openjdk." </i>If you only planning to use Conty to play games, i would suggest you to pick the lite version.<br /><i></i></li><li>Make sure you have Vulkan packages and either NVidia/AMD GPU drivers. This is quite challenging because each release will have it's own spesific version depending on ArchLinux update. Release 1.8 will work with NVidia 465.24.02 while 1.8.1 will work with NVidia 465.27.</li><li>You need to set some parameters documented in this <a href="https://github.com/lutris/docs/blob/master/HowToEsync.md">page</a>. I use the the second option, which is modifying the <b>/etc/security/limits.conf</b> file and add this following line: &lt;<b>username</b>&gt;<b> hard nofile 524288</b>. Please note that this method only works when you are logged in using <b>runlevel 3</b>. I tried to use runlevel 4 and lightdm and found out that this method do not work. I think because i haven't configure lightdm correctly, but i will leave this out for you to solve. Make sure to reboot after editing this file as the changes will take effect after a reboot.<br /></li><li>Run this command: <b>./conty_lite.sh steam</b> or <b>./conty_lite.sh lutris</b> to start the installation of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/linux">steam</a> or <a href="https://lutris.net/">lutris</a><b>.</b> </li><li>Once steam or lutris installed, you can start download and play your games directly.</li></ol><p>I hope this short article can help for those who wanted to switch to Slackware Linux but afraid of losing their capabilities to play Windows games available on  Steam.<br /></p><p><i> Update:</i></p><p><i>Conty 1.10 works with NVidia driver 465.31 <br /></i></p></div>

<h4><a href="https://slackblogs.blogspot.com/2021/04/slackware-150-beta-announced-and-sbo.html">Slackware 15.0 Beta Announced and SBo Development Cycle</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>It's a few days late, but Patrick has announced Slackware 15.0 Beta in the Changelog per April 12. It's another milestone after declaring Alpha in February. We are coming closer to final release of Slackware 15.0 after almost five years of development since the release of 14.2 back in 2016. Many things have changes since then and as far as i can see, all the major toolchain is now fixed in Slackware development tree and we are likely focusing to fix the remaining issue reported by many users who have been testing -current for a long time.</p><p>SBo is following up by entering the development cycle for 15.0 repository as per this week and submissions is now closed. No new scripts can be submitted unless it's a new dependency for newer version of the scripts available in the repository and it can only be added by admins. Thanks to Ponce's work on tracking -current, his repository has contained a lot of commits fixing scripts to be buildable on current. That will be a good starting point and we will work on fixing the rest afterwards. This process might take some time as some of the scripts are outdated and some are abandoned by the maintainer or upstream.</p><p>We welcome any help at this point and we do hope that we can release 15.0 repository the same day as Slackware 15.0 gets released like what we did last time.<br /></p></div>

<h4><a href="https://slackblogs.blogspot.com/2021/02/slackware-150-alpha-1.html">Slackware 15.0 Alpha 1</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>It's been a long wait but Patrick has just called the current branch as Alpha 1 as the mass rebuilt due to glibc 2.33 has been done in the weekend. In this massive update, more than 1500 packages were rebuilt against latest glibc 2.33 to make sure it doesn't have any regressions. Please note that the new glibc was just released in February 2021, so it's very new. Good news is that based on most users who have just upgraded, the rebuilt works just fine as expected. I personally have upgraded to the latest version on both my desktop and laptop and it worked just fine. It just takes time to complete the upgrade and remove the .new or merge it with your existing configurations.</p><p>So what's next? Well it's definitely working towards more bug fixing and making sure there are no regressions on the default installation of Slackware 15.0. You can help by downloading the latest ISO <a href="https://slackware.nl/slackware/slackware64-current-iso/">here</a> and install it on your machine, either via VM or in bare metal and report it to the <a href="https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/requests-for-current-14-2-15-0-a-4175620463/">LQ</a> where Patrick and most of the dev team are there to monitor.</p><p>There are still some scheduled upgrades in the future, but they will have to wait until the mass rebuilt is done today and give time for users to test this snapshots. If you are curious, just try to install and use slackware-current now. In my opinion, it's very stable even on daily usage.  <br /></p></div>

<p> I never used XFCE before, but i'm curious about this lightweight desktop environment since it's included in Slackware and has just released it's latest release 4.16. The new version drop GTK+2 support and fully migrated to the newer GTK+3. The announcement of <a href="https://xfce.org/about/news/?post=1608595200">XFCE 4.16</a> showed that this is a major upgrade both in the backend and also in the front-end (UI/visual).

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Linus just announced the next LTS kernel 5.10 last week and 24 hours later, the first point release was released by Greg to revert 2 commits that caused problems, but in less than a week after, it landed straight into Slackware-Current main tree without going into /testing first. So we have a final confirmation that next Slackware release (15.0) will surely use the latest LTS kernel release which will be supported up to 5 years (which will be EOL around 2026).</p><p>Up to this point, NVidia hasn't released any update to their legacy drivers, but that didn't stop me to push the upgrades knowing that there's a patch to make the current Legacy driver works with 5.10. I have pushed the patches onto my <a href="https://github.com/willysr/SlackHacks/tree/master/nvidia/390.138/5.10.x">SlackHacks</a> repository and i have tested it before posting it here. In fact, i'm now running Slackware Linux with Kernel 5.10.1</p><p><span style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="background-color: white; color: black;">uname -a
</span><br />Linux slack64.slackie.org 5.10.1 #1 SMP Sat Dec 19 17:07:30 CST 2020 x86_64 AMD Ryzen 5 1600X Six-Core Processor AuthenticAMD GNU/Linux<br /></span></p><p>One notable differences with previous patch was that it now requires me to run the nvidia-installer with --no-unified-memory parameter or else it would failed to build nvidia-uvm.ko modules. I suspect that this has to do with CUDA things and i don't have it installed on my machine. If you do have CUDA installed, you can try to remove this parameter and see if it works on your machine. <br /></p><p> Hopefully this patch can help users who are still stuck with legacy drivers like me :)<br /></p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>After the big merge (tm) event, i respun two new fresh VM based on latest update on -current and rebuilt all packages for MATE and Cinnamon to see whether there's a breakage or not and it turns out it works very well for MATE. You can use the same script to rebuilt all the packages if it's broken due to the big update.</p><p>As for Cinnamon, i'm using this good chance to push the updates for Cinnamon 4.8.x that has been pushed by upstream developers. I had prepared for this launch when vtown was introduced few weeks ago, but i'm stuck at elogind that didn't get pushed to main tree since it's one of the main dependency for Cinnamon packages besides other things. I'm really glad that it was finally pushed and i can push my changes for Cinnamon 4.8 and provide early preview for Cinnamon 4.8 for Slackware-Current users.</p><p>Binary packages has been uploaded to <a href="http://slackware.uk/csb/current/x86_64/">slackware.uk</a> (Thanks Tadgy) as usual and master branch has been updated as well with the latest commits.</p><p></p><p>Let me know if you find any issues running the script or the binaries.</p><p></p><p>Have fun :)<br /></p></div>

<div class="content">
<p>Hey all, it's been a while since i posted here, but today there's a big update that i want to share to all Slackware users who have waited for this to happen and this is one of the remaining part of my wishlist and that is the one and only, Plasma 5!!!</p><p>Yes, Patrick has finally decided to push Plasma 5 after coming with teaser in previous updates. At this moment, the Plasma 5 packages are still in /testing directory, but i'm guessing it won't be long until it's merged into the main tree along with other updates. I have downloaded the new Plasma 5 packages at my current desktop at home, but didn't have time to upgrade it this morning so i did test the upgrade on my workstation at the office first and once i confirmed it worked well, i perform the upgrade on my laptop which i used to write this post.</p><p>Here's how i perform the upgrade</p><p><b><span style="font-family: courier;">slackpkg update</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-family: courier;">slackpkg upgrade-all (to upgrade poppler and libinput first)</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-family: courier;">slackpkg remove kde (to remove all KDE 4 packages)</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-family: courier;"></span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-family: courier;">cd slackware64-current/testing/packages/vtown</span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-family: courier;">installpkg --install-new --reinstall deps/*.txz kde/*.txz</span></b><span style="font-family: courier;"></span> <br /></p><p>So for your information, the Plasma 5 that were added today consists of KDE Applications 20.08.2, Framework 5.75.0, and Plasma 5.20.2. This is the latest update from KDE developers per October 2020.</p><p>So far, i don't see any major issues with the new Plasma 5, but it will require more extensive testing  to discover issues. I do wish Patrick can keep distributing digiKam. It's a nice application that probably needed by many graphic designers or people that do digital manipulations using digital cameras.</p><p>This is the current Plasma 5 screenshot taken from System Settings on my laptop<br /></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img alt="" /></p><p>

To prevent slackpkg to revert back to the original KDE 4, put this into your /etc/slackpkg/blacklist until Plasma 5 gets added into main tree: <span style="font-family: monospace;"><b><span style="background-color: white; color: black;">[0-9]_vtown_[0-9]</span></b><br /></span></p><p><br /></p></div>

It has been working great so far and with the help of <a href="https://www.enigmail.net/index.php/en/">Enigmail</a>, it's super easy to send encrypted/signed email messages and also to verify them.</div><div><br /></div><div>With the latest release of <a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/2020/07/whats-new-in-thunderbird-78/">Thunderbird 78</a>, things will change a bit. The new Thunderbird 78 will be a new ESR release and it will be full of new features. However, this new release also comes with a significant changes, which is the removal of the old XUL overlays and moving to support MailExtensions and MailExtension Experiments only. This will hugely impact add-ons, including Enigmail. Developers working on add-ons will have to rewrite some or most of their code in order to work with the new technology. <br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Other changes coming to Thunderbird is the out-of-the-box support for OpenPGP and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/introduction-to-e2e-encryption">End-to-End Encryption</a> by default without using any third party add-ons. It has been requested for so long and finally it made it in this release. However, this feature will not be using GnuPG as the backend just like Enigmail, but they will rely on <a href="https://www.rnpgp.com/">RNP library</a>. Alas, in this initial version, it will be less feature than what we have seen in Enigmail, but they are working on other areas as the development goes.</div><div><br /></div><div><img alt="New end-to-end encryption preferences tab." class="alignnone size-large wp-image-843" height="469" src="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2020/07/e2eprefs-600x469.png" width="600" /></div><div><br /></div><div>So what is going to happen with Enigmail development? They will cease support for Thunderbird, but the developer of Enigmail has agreed to move forward and help the migration. The work will be ready by the time Thunderbird 78.2 is released in coming months, so if you are currently using Thunderbird 68.10.0 in production environment, <span style="color: red;"><b>DO NOT UPGRADE to 78.0</b></span> and <b><span style="color: red;">WAIT FOR 78.2 INSTEAD</span></b>!!! If you want to do the initial test on non-production environment, you can try to use the steps from this <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP">Wiki</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<div>Slackware community is very active nowadays, and that's for a reason. They are waiting for the big update coming to Slackware, which is the new Plasma 5 and XFCE. It has been requested for so long after -current start moving, but Pat hasn't made the change until 2020 when big basic components such as Qt5 went in and many followed up.</div><div><br /></div><div>There were some distractions along the way, such as PAM taking some time to test (it was initially planned for a day or two in testing/), but at the end it was a smooth migration. I barely notice any changes since all the changes happening under the hood and it works well both in my MATE and Cinnamon project (basically for Cinnamon since i already have PAM installed, but not as part of the core packages. It just sit there as a requirement for Cinnamon-screensaver).</div><div><br /></div><div>For next Plasma 5 and XFCE, there are some another changes needed for it to go smoothly and that's UPower and elogind. Slackware 14.2 up to -current is still using the old UPower which is already deprecated for some time, but since it's related to many other libraries/applications, Pat kept them until it's time to move on with the rest of the projects and i believe it's time. Newer UPower is needed by Plasma 5, XFCE, <a href="https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-power-manager/commit/92f5ca9facce367ab1eb58cb28326fe5edcd9960">mate-power-manager 1.24</a> (it's still at 1.22 for now due to this constraints) and <a href="https://github.com/CinnamonSlackBuilds/csb/issues/42">better battery support in Cinnamon</a>. <br /></div><div><br /></div><div>The other thing is the need of replacing ConsoleKit2 with elogind. CK2 has been inactive for 3 years and i don't see any future development on the project, so we can't rely on it anymore, while Plasma 5 and others need the session management tool which was initially provided by systemd's logind. As Slackware isn't going to ship systemd anyway, the idea is to use <a href="https://github.com/elogind/elogind">elogind</a>, another fork of systemd that focus on logind module only.</div><div><br /></div><div>Since CK2 is part of the core packages and deals with session management, it must be taken care with caution or else people would ended up getting locked up from their own machine. So Patrick (and alienBOB initially) made some preparations that you can see in the -current ChangeLogs:</div><div><br /></div><div><font size="">a/sysvinit-scripts-2.1-noarch-34.txz:  Rebuilt.<br />
       rc.M: check for elogind first so that we can ignore a stale CK2 package.</font></div><div><font size=""><font size="">x/xinit-1.4.1-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.<br />
       When using elogind, start the session on the current console.<br />
       Thanks to alienBOB.</font></font></div><div><font size=""><font size=""><font size="">a/sysvinit-scripts-2.1-noarch-33.txz:  Rebuilt.<br />
       rc.M: add support for elogind. Thanks to alienBOB.<br />
a/util-linux-2.35.2-x86_64-3.txz:  Rebuilt.<br />
       /etc/pam.d/login: support pam_elogind.so. Thanks to alienBOB.<br /><br /></font></font></font><p style="text-align: left;">We should be seeing more updates soon, but just as an early warning, please <span style="color: red;"><b>DO READ THE CHANGELOGS </b><font color="#000000">and never do blind update.</font></span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: red;"><font color="#000000"></font></span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: red;"><font color="#000000">If you are interested to try the new elogind in action, you might want to see <a href="https://alien.slackbook.org/blog/replacing-consolekit2-with-elogind-first-steps/">AlienBOB's work on Plasma 5 with Wayland and elogind</a> and <a href="https://rlworkman.net/pkgs/current/ChangeLog.txt">Robby's work on XFCE</a><br /></font></span></p></div></div>

<h4><a href="https://slackblogs.blogspot.com/2020/05/slackware-is-now-pamified.html">Slackware is now PAM'ified</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<div>After three months of testing (initially it was planned to be few days only), PAM is finally merged into the main  tree of Slackware-Current per 18 May 2020. Many people have expected this to happen, they just wait for the trigger and finally Pat pushed the changes today.</div><div><br /></div><div>Some people have started to panic about the integration of PAM, but really, there is nothing to worry about. Slackware will still keep to it's root and traditions. The integration of PAM is something inevitable as more and more upstream projects requires PAM as one of the authentication mechanism (including my<a href="https://cinnamonslackbuilds.github.io/" target="_blank"> Cinnamon SlackBuilds project</a>) and the myth about PAM being insecure is no longer valid. Other distributions have been using PAM for many years and they do work well, so it should work well with Slackware as well.</div><div><br /></div><div>Kudos to Patrick and the rest of the crew and some contributors, the integration of PAM is very smooth and there's no breakage at all. Everything works normally before and after the upgrade process as long as you follow the instructions carefully (install those three important packages: <b>pam, libpwquality, cracklib</b>). I have upgraded all my machines (except for my laptop but soon) to the PAM'ified version of Slackware and everything works fine here.</div><div><br /></div><div>I also took this chance to add PAM support to cinnamon-screensaver and bump some packages in deps for <a href="https://mateslackbuilds.github.io/">MATE SlackBuilds project</a>. All the packages in MATE are being rebuilt on a fresh Slackware-Current VM using the latest update that consists of PAM packages.</div><div><br /></div><div>One milestone have been passed and now we are waiting for the next big steps, which is upgrading Plasma and XFCE along with the new UPower.<br /></div></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
Few days ago i saw that Cinnamon 4.6.0 has been released on GitHub and as usual, developers will still release a couple more releases before they mark it stable, but i have made some changes to the SlackBuild scripts and push it to master branch for those who are eager to try the new Cinnamon 4.6.x series.<br />
<br />
I believe this version will be used in the next Linux Mint 20 which will be released in June, but i want Slackware-Current users to try this version first :)<br />
<br />
So as usual, go grab the latest master commit in <a href="https://github.com/cinnamonslackbuilds/csb">github</a> or grab the binary packages in <a href="http://slackware.uk/csb/current/x86_64/">slackware.uk</a> (don't forget to support Tadgy for providing this free service to Slackware community by signing up in his <a href="https://www.patreon.com/slackwareUK">Patreon</a> page).<br />
<br />
Any feedback for the project is very appreciated.</div>
